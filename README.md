## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Position


### What I learned
I found this challenge really interestingðŸ‘Œ. I used the css property background-size for the first time and mix-blend-mode over a background-image to achieve an overlay of background-color.

I also implemented the mobile first approach. And i have decided to always use method ðŸ˜† as i found it easier than desktop first approach.
